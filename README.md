## Overview
Phantom is a unified video generation framework for single and multi-subject references, built on existing text-to-video and image-to-video architectures. It achieves cross-modal alignment using text-image-video triplet data by redesigning the joint text-image injection model. Additionally, it emphasizes subject consistency in human generation while enhancing ID-preserving video generation.
